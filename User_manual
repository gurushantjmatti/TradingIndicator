🔧 1. Where and how to use it

You’ll use it inside TradingView.
Follow this exactly:

Open TradingView.com
 and log in.

Open any chart (e.g. NIFTY, BANKNIFTY, AAPL, BTCUSDT — doesn’t matter).

Click on the “Pine Editor” tab at the bottom of the chart.

Delete everything inside the editor and paste your code there.

Click “Add to chart” (top-right corner of the editor).

Done — the indicator will appear on the chart.

You can then save it as your own script by clicking the floppy disk icon and naming it something like “CPR by TheSniperTrader with SMAs”.

🧭 2. What this indicator shows

This script plots Central Pivot Range (CPR) and Pivot levels for:

Today’s CPR (support & resistance zones)

Tomorrow’s projected CPR (based on today’s OHLC)

Moving Averages (20, 50, 200 SMA)

In short:
It gives you the market structure (CPR zones) + trend direction (SMAs).
